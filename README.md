# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This notebook contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset using Python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib. The objective is to uncover meaningful patterns and insights related to passenger survival during the Titanic disaster.

# Objectives

- Load and clean the Titanic dataset
- Explore data types and missing values
- Visualize survival distribution based on:
  - Gender
  - Passenger class
  - Age
  - Embarkation point
- Create advanced visualizations (swarm plots, heatmap,missing data heatmap)
- Understand relationships between features and survival


# Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (via Kaggle)


# Key Visualizations

- Survival count plots
- Survival by gender and class
- Age distribution (histograms & KDE)
- Swarm plot of age vs survival
- Heatmap of feature correlations and missing data
- Boxplots of fare distribution


# Key Insights

- Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate.
- First class passengers were more likely to survive.
- Younger passengers tended to survive more often.
- Cherbourg (C) embarkation point had a higher survival percentage.
